# Interaction with workers

If someone asks you what you do, and as you are aware and you might not actually have any society-acceptable work then you can do several things.
For instance, Sundberg says that he is in between jobs. 
Where have you gone to school... At that moment you have to create a reality for yourself that is if you would not go through the following process would be misleading and a lie. 

The past is nothing but emotionally mediated memories. With this I mean is that we think we have an objective view of what happened in our life. Sure, we have events that we can corroborate with people. But there are also many thing that you have *forgotten* and that you now will *remember*.

First you need to make a list of all the things that you actually did but did not finish successfully. Society and it's game of having people chase achievements against each other (your achievement of knowing how to write is nothing while in the middle ages it was something exceptional).

For instance. Let's say you are a college dropout. But are you? You are still studying whatever the curriculum was so instead of saying, oh 20 years ago I dropped out of college. This is unfair to yourself and also unproductive for the [non-outcome oriented manifesting] that we might want to give a chance. You can do this yourself or you can do this with a friend. What you are going to do is creating a reality field distortion that will become an honest truth. Instead of terrorizing ourselves with the inadeqacies of language (it's fixed space in time, it's construed to implicitly support values that are only to benefit to the 'material achievers').   






This is a quick node project template for demoing Codespaces. It is based off of the [Azure node sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world). It's great!!!
